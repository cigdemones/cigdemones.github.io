    <p>The domain of artificial intelligence is huge in breadth and width. </p>
    
    <h2>Speech and Voice Recognition</h2>
    <p>These both terms are common in robotics, expert systems and natural language processing. Though these terms are used interchangeably, their objectives are different.</p>

    <h4> Working of Speech and Voice Recognition Systems
    </h4>The user input spoken at a microphone goes to sound card of the system. The converter turns the analog signal into equivalent digital signal for the speech processing. The database is used to compare the sound patterns to recognize the words. Finally, a reverse feedback is given to the database.<br> <br>
    This source-language text becomes input to the Translation Engine, which converts it to the target language text. They are supported with interactive GUI, large database of vocabulary, etc.
