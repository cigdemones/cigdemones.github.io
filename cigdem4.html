<h1> Making Self-Driving Cars Smarter with AI 
</h1>
<p align="justify">At the end of 2015, Denis Sverdlov, CEO of auto manufacturer Kinetik, announced a joint venture between Formula E and Kinetik to create the Roborace self-driving race series within a year. Roborace will feature 20 identical cars allocated to 10 teams. They will run on the same circuits as Formula E, except without drivers. <br> <br>
    The cars won’t be remote-controlled, either, they’ll be fully autonomous, using the NVIDIA Drive PX 2 supercomputer to run the software. All cars will be mechanically identical so that the winning team’s success will depend on the best artificial intelligence.

<h2>AI and dashcams for smart vehicles

</h2>
<p align="justify">While early self-driving car companies, including Google, use expensive LIDAR sensors to visually understand what’s going on around a vehicle, Palo Alto-based NAUTO uses the type of image sensors found in “prosumer” cameras. When used in combination with motion sensors and GPS systems, accurate situational awareness can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost. <br><br>
    Using AI to interpret the information streamed from relatively cheap dashcams, NAUTO’s systems can detect what’s happening on the road ahead of a driver and within the vehicle. 
These new technologies not only make roadway object-recognition possible, but they also improve the human-machine interface by opening up possibilities in facial and gesture recognition.</p>
